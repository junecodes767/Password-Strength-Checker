# Password-Strength-Checker
Password Validation Tool

This Python script ensures strong password creation by validating input against a series of security requirements. The program prompts users to:

- Enter a password that is at least 8 characters long.
- Include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character (!, @, #, $).
- Optionally, extend the password to 16 or more characters for added security.
- Remove common weak patterns like qwerty, 123, or 1qaz2wsx.
- If the password passes all checks, it is marked as strong, helping users create more secure passwords.
